# Benchmarks

zvidlib's benchmarks run under [criterion](https://docs.rs/criterion) with
`harness = false`, across three bench targets that share `benches/support/`:

| Target | Measures |
| --- | --- |
| `benches/codec.rs` | codec work: decode, encoder inputs, and the per-ISA SIMD groups |
| `benches/audio_decode.rs` | the audio decode path: AAC access units and `AacSampleReader` range/seek reads |
| `benches/audio_mux.rs` | the audio container path: MP4 muxing, sample-table growth, demux, and gapless timing |

Each target loads and decodes its fixtures once per process, so every iteration
measures the work under test and nothing else. `codec` is one target rather than
several because its groups share the same decoded-frame cache; the two audio
targets share none of those fixtures and are separately runnable.

## Running

```sh
cargo bench                       # the default, fast groups in every target
cargo bench --bench codec         # codec work only
cargo bench --bench audio_decode  # the audio decode path only
cargo bench --bench audio_mux     # the audio container path only
cargo bench --features simd       # the same groups, recorded under `simd=on`
cargo bench --no-run              # compile only
```

Criterion writes HTML reports to `target/criterion/report/index.html`.

### Filtering to one group or benchmark

Criterion treats its first positional argument as a regular expression matched
against the full benchmark id:

```sh
cargo bench --bench codec -- av1_decode          # one codec's group
cargo bench --bench codec -- 'simd=off'          # one feature arm
cargo bench --bench codec -- inter_show_existing # one benchmark
```

Use `--warm-up-time` and `--measurement-time` for a quicker smoke run:

```sh
cargo bench --bench codec -- --warm-up-time 0.5 --measurement-time 2
```

### The long-running 1080p group

The bundled `examples/media/BigBuckBunny.mp4` sample is 768 frames of 1920x1080
decoded by a pure-Rust decoder, so it is not part of the default run. Opt in with
an environment variable:

```sh
ZVIDLIB_BENCH_LARGE=1 cargo bench --bench codec -- hevc_decode_1080p
```

## Group naming and the `simd` feature

`simd` is an additive, off-by-default cargo feature. The crate's vector kernels
are selected by runtime CPU feature detection, so the feature gates no code
today; it exists as the switch the per-codec benchmark work codes against.

Every criterion group name ends in the arm it was measured under —
`hevc_decode_1080p/simd=off` versus `hevc_decode_1080p/simd=on` — so the two
builds record separately and stay comparable in one report.

## Scalar versus SIMD

The `simd` feature above distinguishes two *builds*. The instruction set is a
separate, finer axis, and it is the one a SIMD comparison actually turns on:
zvidlib's kernels are chosen by runtime CPU feature detection, so scalar and
vector arms can both be measured in a single run.

`zvidlib::simd` is the process-wide switch that makes that possible:

```rust
use zvidlib::simd::{self, SimdIsa};

simd::set_override(Some(SimdIsa::Scalar)); // every kernel, HEVC and AV1
// ... run the workload ...
simd::set_override(None);                  // back to per-host detection
```

`set_override` reaches every dispatch family at once: the AV1 transforms and
in-loop filters, AV1 motion compensation, AV1 intra prediction, and every HEVC
engine kernel (inter/intra prediction, in-loop filters, inverse transforms, and
encoder-side distortion metrics). An instruction set this host cannot execute is
clamped to `SimdIsa::Scalar` rather than silently ignored, so the arm you asked
for is always a defined one. `simd::active()` reports what is in force and
`simd::available()` lists what this host can run.

Groups built through `support::isa::bench_across_isas` run once per entry in
`simd::available()` and are named `<codec>/<isa>`, so criterion compares the
arms directly:

```
av1_deblock/scalar
av1_deblock/neon
av1_motion_compensation/scalar
av1_motion_compensation/neon
```

On an `x86_64` host with AVX2 the arms are `scalar`, `sse4.1`, and `avx2`
instead. These groups deliberately carry the instruction set in the name rather
than the `simd=on`/`simd=off` build tag: the instruction set *is* the measured
axis here, and both arms always appear in the same run.

Filter to one of them the same way as any other group:

```sh
cargo bench --bench codec -- av1_deblock
cargo bench --bench codec -- 'av1_deblock/scalar'
```

The per-ISA HEVC group decodes the bundled 1080p sample, so it sits behind the
same `ZVIDLIB_BENCH_LARGE=1` opt-in as the other 1080p group.

### Correctness guard

Every per-ISA group runs `assert_bit_exact_across_isas` before timing anything:
each arm's output must be byte-identical to the scalar arm's. This is not
optional ceremony. Every vector backend in the crate is documented as bit-exact
with its scalar reference, and a speedup produced by a kernel that quietly
diverged would look like progress. If a backend disagrees, the benchmark panics
instead of reporting a number.

### Reading a null result

`simd::active_by_site()` reports what each dispatch family resolved to
individually:

```rust
for (site, isa) in zvidlib::simd::active_by_site() {
    println!("{site}: {}", isa.name());
}
```

The harness asserts on this before every timed arm, and you should too if you
are interpreting a surprising result. **A timing difference is not proof the
switch landed, and the absence of one is not proof it did not.** Some kernels
are near parity with their scalar reference on some hosts — the HEVC arms come
out roughly even on Apple Silicon, where LLVM auto-vectorizes the scalar code
well under `lto = "fat"`, while AV1 deblocking and motion compensation on the
same host are 2.4-4.9x. `active_by_site()` answers the question directly.

## The audio container path

`cargo bench --bench audio_mux` measures the audio write and read paths in two
groups.

`audio_mux` is the write side:

* `media_output_1s_30fps` drives a whole synchronized `MediaOutput` session --
  index checking, timeline interval validation, encoder dispatch, muxer writes,
  the gapless drain, and finalization -- over one second of 48 kHz stereo audio
  and 30 video frames.
* `sample_table_1500_packets` and `sample_table_15000_packets` drive the muxer
  alone over a long audio-only track. The muxer writes one chunk per sample, so
  `stsz` and `co64` each grow by a fixed width per sample while `stts` and `stsc`
  stay run-length constant. The two sizes are an order of magnitude apart on
  purpose: the *ratio* between them is the regression guard, and it should stay
  close to linear.

`audio_demux` is the read side, over the bundled sample's real AAC track:
`Mp4Demuxer::open` (which parses those same sample tables back),
`to_encoded_audio_samples` (packet extraction over the decoded sample clock), and
`audio_timing` (priming, padding, and edit-list mapping).

### There is no audio encoder to benchmark

`AudioEncoder` (`src/codec.rs`) is a trait with no implementation in the crate.
Its only implementor anywhere in the tree is `PcmFixtureEncoder` in
`tests/indexed_mp4_output.rs`, a test double that packages PCM without
compressing anything. "Benchmark the audio encoder" therefore has no subject, and
this target does not invent one -- whether the crate should grow a native AAC-LC
encoder, delegate to a platform encoder (AudioToolbox / Media Foundation), or
leave the trait for platform and web backends to fill is a product decision.

The bench-local `PcmBenchEncoder` is the same kind of pass-through double, and it
is bench-local on purpose: holding codec work at effectively zero is what makes
the measurement isolate container work.

### No SIMD axis

Muxing and demuxing are bit-shuffling and table building, not arithmetic over
sample arrays, so there is nothing here for a vector kernel to do. These groups
run on the detected instruction set only and do not use `bench_across_isas`. They
still carry the `simd=off` / `simd=on` build tag every group name carries,
because that tag records which *build* produced a number, not which kernel ran.

## Fixtures

`benches/support/` loads only fixtures already checked into the repository:

| Helper | Fixture |
| --- | --- |
| `av1_lossless_intra_stream` / `av1_lossless_intra_frame` | `tests/fixtures/codec/av1_lossless_17x9.hex` |
| `av1_inter_stream` / `av1_inter_temporal_units` | `tests/fixtures/codec/av1_inter_show_existing_16x16.hex` |
| `bundled_hevc_sample` | `examples/media/BigBuckBunny.mp4` |
| `bundled_aac_track` / `bundled_mp4_bytes` | `examples/media/BigBuckBunny.mp4` (its AAC-LC stereo track) |
| `aac_mono_track` | `tests/fixtures/codec/aac_lc_mono_48k.m4a` |
| `synthetic_yuv420_sequence` | generated; encoder inputs without decoding first |

Every one of them is cached in a `OnceLock`, so the demux and decode cost is paid
once per process rather than once per iteration.

## Throughput

`support::FrameWork` describes the pixel work one iteration performs.
`support::report_throughput` sets `Throughput::Elements(frames)` — criterion then
prints a frames/sec rate — and prints the megapixels each frame carries, which
converts that rate to megapixels per second.

Audio has no pixels, so it reports on its own scale: `support::AudioWork` and
`support::report_audio_throughput` set `Throughput::Elements(samples)` — a
per-channel samples/sec rate — and print the sample rate and covered duration,
which convert that rate to a factor of realtime. Both sides of the write path and
both sides of the read path use it, so mux, demux, and AAC decode numbers stay
directly comparable. A benchmark that touches no samples (`audio_timing`, which is
O(edits)) deliberately registers no throughput rather than reporting a fabricated
sample rate.

The `audio_decode` groups additionally print their own `NNNx realtime` line from a
single separately timed pass, because x-realtime is the figure a playback path is
judged by and criterion has no unit for it.

## Profile

`[profile.bench]` repeats `[profile.release]`'s `lto = "fat"` and
`codegen-units = 1`. Cargo's `bench` profile only inherits `release`'s *defaults*,
not the values set in `Cargo.toml`, so without this the numbers would be measured
without the whole-crate optimization that shipped builds get.

## Targets

Benchmarks are native-only. They are declared as explicit `[[bench]]` targets and
criterion is a `cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))` dev-dependency, so the `wasm32`
builds neither resolve nor compile them.

Each bench target is its own crate root and compiles all of `benches/support/`,
but uses only the fixtures its own measurements need, so the module carries
`#![allow(dead_code)]`: without it `cargo clippy --all-targets` would fail one
target over helpers another target depends on.

`benches/support/` holds everything that is not the measurement: fixtures and
synthetic inputs in `support`, and the scalar-vs-SIMD axis in `support::isa`
(`bench_across_isas`, the bit-exactness guard, and the per-site override
assertion).

## Audio groups

`benches/audio_decode.rs` measures two layers, and keeps them in separate groups
on purpose:

| Group | What it measures |
| --- | --- |
| `aac_decode` | `NativeAacDecoder::decode` over a fixed run of access units, mono and stereo |
| `aac_reader_sequential` | `AacSampleReader::get_range` re-reading a resident range, and walking forward |
| `aac_reader_seek` | random-access ranges, each forcing a decoder reset and a preroll re-decode |
| `aac_reader_edits` | reads crossing edit-list boundaries and gapless priming/padding trims |

`AacSampleReader` keeps decoded packets in a `BTreeMap`, so the same call costs
two very different things depending on whether the requested media range is
already resident. `cached_repeat_stereo_48k` is the pure hit path — no decode at
all — and everything in `aac_reader_seek` is the cold path. Reporting them
together would average the seek cost away, and the seek cost is the one that
shows up as an audible stall.

These groups carry **no `simd=` tag and no per-ISA arms**. AAC decoding is
delegated to the third-party `symphonia-codec-aac` crate, `zvidlib::simd`'s
override does not reach it, and the crate has no audio SIMD kernels of its own,
so a scalar arm and a vector arm would be the same code reported twice.

The mono fixture exists because the bundled sample is stereo and carries no edit
list, while `NativeAacDecoder` accepts AAC-LC mono as well (and rejects
everything beyond stereo, so mono and stereo are its entire supported input
space). It also supplies the real `elst` and decoder-priming timing the bundled
sample does not have.
