# Benchmarks

zvidlib's benchmarks run under [criterion](https://docs.rs/criterion) with
`harness = false`. The whole suite lives in a single bench target
(`benches/codec.rs`) so the shared fixture cache in `benches/support/` is loaded
and decoded once per process and each iteration measures codec work only.

## Running

```sh
cargo bench                       # the default, fast groups
cargo bench --features simd       # the same groups, recorded under `simd=on`
cargo bench --no-run              # compile only
```

Criterion writes HTML reports to `target/criterion/report/index.html`.

### Filtering to one group or benchmark

Criterion treats its first positional argument as a regular expression matched
against the full benchmark id:

```sh
cargo bench --bench codec -- av1_decode          # one codec's group
cargo bench --bench codec -- 'simd=off'          # one feature arm
cargo bench --bench codec -- inter_show_existing # one benchmark
```

Use `--warm-up-time` and `--measurement-time` for a quicker smoke run:

```sh
cargo bench --bench codec -- --warm-up-time 0.5 --measurement-time 2
```

### The long-running 1080p group

The bundled `examples/media/BigBuckBunny.mp4` sample is 768 frames of 1920x1080
decoded by a pure-Rust decoder, so it is not part of the default run. Opt in with
an environment variable:

```sh
ZVIDLIB_BENCH_LARGE=1 cargo bench --bench codec -- hevc_decode_1080p
```

## Group naming and the `simd` feature

`simd` is an additive, off-by-default cargo feature. The crate's vector kernels
are selected by runtime CPU feature detection, so the feature gates no code
today; it exists as the switch the per-codec benchmark work codes against.

Every criterion group name ends in the arm it was measured under —
`hevc_decode_1080p/simd=off` versus `hevc_decode_1080p/simd=on` — so the two
builds record separately and stay comparable in one report.

## Fixtures

`benches/support/` loads only fixtures already checked into the repository:

| Helper | Fixture |
| --- | --- |
| `av1_lossless_intra_stream` / `av1_lossless_intra_frame` | `tests/fixtures/codec/av1_lossless_17x9.hex` |
| `av1_inter_stream` / `av1_inter_temporal_units` | `tests/fixtures/codec/av1_inter_show_existing_16x16.hex` |
| `bundled_hevc_sample` | `examples/media/BigBuckBunny.mp4` |
| `synthetic_yuv420_sequence` | generated; encoder inputs without decoding first |

Every one of them is cached in a `OnceLock`, so the demux and decode cost is paid
once per process rather than once per iteration.

## Throughput

`support::FrameWork` describes the pixel work one iteration performs.
`support::report_throughput` sets `Throughput::Elements(frames)` — criterion then
prints a frames/sec rate — and prints the megapixels each frame carries, which
converts that rate to megapixels per second.

## Profile

`[profile.bench]` repeats `[profile.release]`'s `lto = "fat"` and
`codegen-units = 1`. Cargo's `bench` profile only inherits `release`'s *defaults*,
not the values set in `Cargo.toml`, so without this the numbers would be measured
without the whole-crate optimization that shipped builds get.

## Targets

Benchmarks are native-only. They are declared as an explicit `[[bench]]` target
and criterion is a `cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))` dev-dependency, so the
`wasm32` builds neither resolve nor compile them.
